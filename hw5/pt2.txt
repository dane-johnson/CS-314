A soft link is a link that references another file in the file system. It is beneficial because it helps protect the integrety of the original file by linking to another reference, so the inode is always referenced from the same entry point. Soft links do not automatically know about changes to the underlying file, and can become orphaned if the referencing file is renamed or deleted.

A hard link is a reference not to a file but to an inode. This is useful because it means a file can effectively exist at multiple locations in a system. It can create problems from a memory management perspective, as the underlying file data is not deleted until every reference is removed, and it may not be obvious that there are still references to a file. It also creates problems with implementation, as it complicates the 1-1 bitmapping of the free block list. Additionally, directories cannot have multiple hard links, or there is a risk of circular referencing.
