The system is scheduleable.

The voice call requires only 2 msec of cpu time per 10, or 1/5 of the cpu time.

The video needs to run 40 frames per second, with each frame taking 15 msec to buffer.
Knowing this, we know to buffer the video we need only 600 msec/sec, or 3/5 of the cpu time.

Thus, we can schedule these two real-time systems with using only 4/5 of the cpu time.
