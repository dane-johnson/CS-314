# CS-314
Directory of programs I wrote for CS 314, "Operating Systems" 

Note that DLXOS is not my software, it was created and is owned by University of California, Santa Cruz. To run these portions of the program, you need the DLX compiler and simulator, ~which are not publically available~ available [here](https://www2.ucsc.edu/courses/cmps111-elm/dlx/index.shtml).

Portions of this program were written by Bryson Hunsaker and Professor Igor Crk, so please contact them as well as me for permission to utilize any part of this repository.
