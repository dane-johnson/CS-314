I think this project went well mostly because it could be split into two distinct parts. I love to get down to it right away on assignments, so after meeting to discuss answers to the design questions, we could easily divide the workload. I took the first half (implementing locks) and got it done right away. I think if the workload was heavier, things could have gotten tight, but given the simplicity of the design and the extension on the time, everything was done in good time.
